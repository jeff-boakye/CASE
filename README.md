# CASE

## Computational Autonomous Systems Environment

**Author:** Jeff Boakye  
**Status:** Research Whitepaper (v1.0)

CASE is a human-language, language-agnostic, secure execution environment that operates as a computational layer above traditional operating systems.

Instead of interacting with computers through low-level syntax and unsafe privilege escalation, CASE enables users to express computational intent in natural language, which is translated into deterministic execution plans, safely executed in isolated environments, and automatically tested, audited, and benchmarked.

CASE does not replace Linux, Windows, or macOS. It abstracts their complexity and standardizes execution across platforms.

## Core Ideas

- Intent-based computation (English → Execution)
- Language-agnostic runtime (Python, C++, Rust, Java, JavaScript, WASM)
- Capability-based security model (no sudo)
- Autonomous testing and verification
- Optional decentralized execution layer
